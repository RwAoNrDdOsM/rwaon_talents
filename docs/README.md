# Change Notes

## Talents

#### Pyromancer
+ Focusing Lens (Tier 1, Slot 1) - Reduced range spread by 40% (increased from 25%)
  
   + *This was previously not a significant enough difference and needed more increased effectiveness. This will be especially noticeable on the primary fire of the Bolt staff, for instance.*

+ Scarlet Infusion (Tier 1, Slot 2) - When you kill a elite or special with your ranged weapon, you gain 5% increased weapon power, for 10 seconds, up to 5 stacks.

    + *The attack speed bonus of the original talent (Martial Study) has been moved to One with the Flame. Martial Study has then replaced with this talent to allow the Pyromancer’s to choose to specialise as an elite/special killer.*

+ Ashen Form (Tier 2, Slot 1) - All burning dots now apply to armoured enemies.
  
   + *This talent has been reworked due to being chosen infrequently, and generally being overshadowed by the other choices. This talent now allows the Pyromancer be able to damage both armour and super armoured targets with multiple staves.*

+ Boiling Blood (Tier 2, Slot 3) - 
  Increases the duration of all burning dots.
  
   + *Quickening removed and replaced due to not interacting well with temporary HP, and charge speed that falling into Battle Wizard’s niche.*
   + *All burning dots durations are increased by 100% (2 times as long), except beam which is 50% (1.5 times as long)*

+ Martial Studies (Tier 3, Slot 1) - 
  Critical Mass also increases headshot power boost by 10% per 6 overcharge and stacks up to 5 times.
  
   + *Shield of Tarnus removed and replaced due to not fitting the more offencive nature of the class. This talent gives the Pyromancer another choice to help with elite/special killing, while still helping in more regular combat.*

+ One With The Flame (Tier 3, Slot 2) - Critical Mass also increases attack speed by 3% per 6 overcharge and stacks up to 5 times.
  
    + *Buffed to by 1% per stack to encompass the removal of Martial Study.*

+ Spirit-Binding (Tier 4, Slot 2) - Melee critical strikes and headshots restore 2 temporary health. Critical headshots restore twice as much.
  
    + *Changed from killing blows. This was done to fit the theme of the class, which focuses around critical strikes.*

+ Embodiment of Aqshy (Tier 5, Slot 1) - The Burning Head now grants 10 seconds of 15% increase movement/attack speed and a overcharge reduction of 1 for every hit.
  
    + *Exhaust: Removed and replaced. This acts as the reverse of the Bonded Flame, encouraging you to get to high overheat and then use your ultimate, rather than the reverse.*

+ Fiery Heart (Tier 5, Slot 3) - The Burning Head now grants 10 seconds of 20% increased power.
  
    + *Reworked. Cooldown reduction talents, in general, feel like a binary choice of mandatory or never taken. This talent was reworked instead to give the Pyromancer a choice in this row to give her significant on-demand power boost, that works both for melee and ranged combat.*


## Weapons:

#### Conflagoration Staff:
+ AOE range increased by 20% 
+ Initial damage decreased by 50% 
+ Dot duration increased to 5 seconds 
+ Time Between Dot Damages decreased to 1 second 
  
  + *This staff was redesigned so as to be an area-control and damage over time weapon, as fits its theme, as opposed to direct damage.*

#### Fireball Staff Charged Shot:
+ Increase min radius by 10%
+ Increase max radius by 20%
+ Increase overall damage by ~17%
+ Increase overcharge cost from 7 to 9
  
  + *This was changed to reduce the “spamminess” that the staff currently experiences, without decreasing its overall damage output.*
