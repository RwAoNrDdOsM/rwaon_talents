# Vermintide 2 Reworks

This mod's purpose is to rework Warhammer: Vermintide 2 to enhance it's gameplay.

This is the Change Notes for the second Private Beta Release.

# Change Notes

## Ultimates

#### Handmaiden
+ 50% increase distance of dash 
+ You are now able to rotate in dash.
+ No dmg on hit and bleed has been removed.
+ Increased Cooldown to 40 seconds. (from 20 seconds)

  + *Bleed effect removed from baseline ultimate ability in order to be able to add differentiation to talents. Cooldown increased to bring ultimate more in line with other careers’ ultimates of similar types. To compensate, the player should have increased control over, and distance options from the ultimate ability.*

## Passives

#### Handmaiden

+ Renewal
  + Regen buff decreased by 50% (from 100%)
  + Aura range increased to 10 (from 5)

   + *This change was done to be less restrictive with positioning for the aura to apply to teammates. The decreased effectiveness is to simultaneously disallow the handmaiden aura to completely negate the stamina changes from the Big Balance Beta, while also allowing one to gain this effectiveness back via talent choice.*

## Talents

#### Pyromancer
+ Focusing Lens (Tier 1, Slot 1) - Reduced range spread by 40% (increased from 25%)
  
   + *This was previously not a significant enough difference and needed more increased effectiveness. This will be especially noticeable on the primary fire of the Bolt staff, for instance.*

+ Scarlet Infusion (Tier 1, Slot 2) - When you kill a elite or special, you gain 3% increased weapon power, for 10 seconds, up to 5 stacks.

    + *The attack speed bonus of the original talent (Martial Study) has been moved to One with the Flame. Martial Study has then replaced with this talent to allow the Pyromancer’s to choose to specialise as an elite/special killer.*
    + *This was changed as it was powerful but had hardly any uptime.*

+ ~~Ashen Form (Tier 2, Slot 1) - All burning dots now apply to armoured enemies.~~
  
   + *~~This talent has been reworked due to being chosen infrequently, and generally being overshadowed by the other choices. This talent now allows the Pyromancer be able to damage both armour and super armoured targets with multiple staves.~~*
   
   + *Removed for now as this Talent is broken*

+ Boiling Blood (Tier 2, Slot 3) - 
  Increases the duration of all burning dots by 50%.
  
   + *Quickening removed and replaced due to not interacting well with temporary HP, and charge speed that falling into Battle Wizard’s niche.*
   + *All burning dots durations are increased by 50%. This has been changed as it was to overpowered at 100%*

+ Martial Studies (Tier 3, Slot 1) - 
  Critical Mass also increases headshot power boost by 10% per 6 overcharge and stacks up to 5 times.
  
   + *Shield of Tarnus removed and replaced due to not fitting the more offencive nature of the class. This talent gives the Pyromancer another choice to help with elite/special killing, while still helping in more regular combat.*

+ One With The Flame (Tier 3, Slot 2) - Critical Mass also increases attack speed by 3% per 6 overcharge and stacks up to 5 times.
  
    + *Buffed to by 1% per stack to encompass the removal of Martial Study.*

+ Spirit-Binding (Tier 4, Slot 2) - Melee critical strikes and headshots restore 2 temporary health. Critical headshots restore twice as much.
  
    + *Changed from killing blows. This was done to fit the theme of the class, which focuses around critical strikes.*

+ Embodiment of Aqshy (Tier 5, Slot 1) - The Burning Head now grants 10 seconds of 15% increase movement/attack speed and a overcharge reduction of 1 for every hit.
  
    + *Exhaust: Removed and replaced. This acts as the reverse of the Bonded Flame, encouraging you to get to high overheat and then use your ultimate, rather than the reverse.*

+ Bonded Flame (Tier 5, Slot 2) - The Burning Head grants 40 temporary health when used, but cooldown of The Burning Head is increased by 50%

    + *Nerf. Bonded Flame seemed like always the best option in T5, as it was a medkit with the added bonus of The Burning Head. These changes try to alievate the problems with this talent without completely reworking it.*

+ Fiery Heart (Tier 5, Slot 3) - The Burning Head now grants 10 seconds of 20% increased power.
  
    + *Reworked. Cooldown reduction talents, in general, feel like a binary choice of mandatory or never taken. This talent was reworked instead to give the Pyromancer a choice in this row to give her significant on-demand power boost, that works both for melee and ranged combat.*

#### Handmaiden
+ Asrai Vigour (Tier 1, Slot 1) - Increased to two stamina shields.

+ Defiance (New Tier 1, Slot 3) - Gain 10% damage reduction
  
   + *This talent was added to give a third defencive option to this row of talents.*

+ Quiver a Plenty (Moved to Tier 2, Slot 1) - Increased to 50% ammo increased.
  
   + *This was moved from the first row to the second row to for similar reasons as Defiance, which is to have this row to have all offencive options.*

+ Vaul’s Blessing (Tier 2, Slot 3) - Increases attack speed by 10%
  
   + *This talent replaces the old Defiance, which did not fit team-oriented nature of the game, nor fit the off offencive nature of this row.*
   
+ Handmainden’s Grace (Tier 5, Slot 1) - You can now dash a second time within 5 seconds
  
   + *This replaces Gift of Ladrielle, increasing the Handmaiden’s mobility dramatically and ability to reposition as needed.*

+ Bladedancer (Tier 5, Slot 2) - Allows the dash to do damage and bleed
  
   + *This damage and bleed is at Bladedancer live values*
   + *This returns the bleed to the Handmaiden’s ultimate ability, giving her some offencive capability with her ultimate.*

+ Hukon’s Wrath (new Tier 5, Slot 3) - Dash now has a stagger effect but cooldown of Dash is increased by 25%.
  
   + *Handmaiden’s Grace removed, and replaced with Hukon’s Wrath. Gives the Handmaiden access to boss-level stagger, functioning much like Footknight’s charge in terms of stagger power.*

## Weapons:

#### Sienna:
##### Conflagoration Staff AOE Attack:
+ AOE range increased by 20% 
+ Initial damage decreased by 50% 
+ Dot duration increased to 5 seconds 
+ Time Between Dot Damages decreased to 1 second
+ Tweaked damage for conflag dot (since first release)
  
  + *This staff was redesigned so as to be an area-control and damage over time weapon, as fits its theme, as opposed to direct damage.*

##### Fireball Staff Charged Shot:
+ Decreased min radius by 10% from first build (Now the same as live)
+ Increase max radius by 20%
+ Increase overall damage by ~17%
+ Increase overcharge cost from 7 to 9
+ Modified Base Overcharge (~4.5 overcharge max to ~5.6 max from quick charges)
+ Increased Explosion Damage by 20%
  
  + *This was changed to reduce the “spamminess” that the staff currently experiences, without decreasing its overall damage output.*
  
#### Handmaiden:
##### Hagbane:
+ Double duration of dot
+ Double damage between dot damages
  
  + *This was changed to have the Hagbane bow fit the theme of a DoT-based weapon more while not changing its total damage output.*
  
##### Glaive:
+ Made light attacks cancelable with blocks and weapon switches
+ Some increase to light damage
+ Removal of linesman
+ Reduction of damage-cleave

  + *Glaive reworked. This was done in order to change it be a more single-target oriented weapon rather than a horde clearing weapon. The weapon should now cleave to, and damage a second target, but stop there. In exchange, it will do increased damage to the first target, and offer a powerful choice as an elite killing weapon.*
