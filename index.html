The affected challenges are:</p><ul><li>“Shove off!” – Push a gutter runner off a pounced ally.</li><li>“Pushy fellow(ess?)” – Push a pouncing gutter runner.</li><li>“Suppressed suppressor” – Kill a ratling gunner pinning (firing at) an ally.</li><li>“Forecasting clear skies” – Kill a blightstormer while he’s conjuring a vortex.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are also removing Red Shell from our game. Red Shell was an analytics service we used to track the impact of our marketing campaigns. Our players have raised concerns over the implications of tracking via third party solutions, especially in regard to conformance to GDPR. We have decided to no longer use Red Shell.</p><p>A while ago, we fixed a bug that caused you to be able to roll “Power vs. Chaos” and “Power vs. Skaven” on Charms. We don’t like the idea of having a combination that covers all bases for Charms – it prevents you from making meaningful choices in your gear.</p><p>But we also realize that this combination was available from launch – it’s not fair to remove it from the game while some equipment still has this specific combination of properties. So we’re adding it back in.</p><p>We’re sorry for failing to communicate when we changed these available properties – we will do a better job at communicating this in the future.</p></div><div class="content-area max-width align-center"><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598" src="http://www.vermintide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/decoration_1.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.vermintide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/decoration_1.png 480w, http://www.vermintide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/decoration_1-300x13.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" width="480" height="20"></p></div><div class="content-area max-width "><h3>Patch 1.1.0.5</h3><p>This is a small patch addressing some minor issues noted in 1.1.0.4.</p><h3 class="bb_h1">Bug fixes</h3><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Fixed some missing localisation</li><li>Fixed Slayer Bardin from having his secondary Melee option from being unequipped as a result of the equipment verification process introduced in 1.1.0.4</li></ul></div><div class="content-area max-width align-center"><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598" src="http://www.vermintide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/decoration_1.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.vermintide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/decoration_1.png 480w, http://www.vermintide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/decoration_1-300x13.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" width="480" height="20"></p></div><div class="content-area max-width "><h3>Patch 1.1.0.4</h3><p>In this version, we’re fixing a few issues – including issues with Okri’s Challenges, and reducing the number of backend errors.</p><h3 class="bb_h1">Bug fixes</h3><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Fixed an issue where the Veteran Crossbow “Vengrynaz Drekmaraz” would look blurry in third person view.</li><li>Fixed an issue where reaching level 30 on Bardin would award the Steam Achievement for reaching level 30 on Sienna.</li><li>Fixed an issue where completing the Prologue would not unlock Okri’s Challenge “Escaped!”. You will, however, have to replay the Prologue from the main menu to be able to claim it.</li><li>Fixed an issue with Ironbreaker Bardin’s Talent “Miners Rythm” where the stamina regeneration would not trigger when using the Axe and Shield’s second and third heavy attacks.</li><li>Fixed an issue with Mercenary Kruber’s hat “Estalian Conquistador”, where his ears were showing through solid metal.</li></ul><h3 class="bb_h1">Tweaks &amp; Changes</h3><ul class="bb_ul"><li>All portrait frames can now be used by all careers.</li><li>The Challenge “Braindead” has a new icon.</li><li>The game now validates equipment and cosmetic items, so that you can’t end up with Bardin’s hats on Kerillian’s body. Now, fun times in the modded realm won’t spill over to the more serious, official realm.</li><li>In 1.1.0.3 we introduced a serial queue for these network requests, which significantly reduced the occurrences of these errors. We’ve made additional changes to how we handle backend error codes like 1199 or 1342 in this version where we retry these network request. This should reduce these errors further.</li></ul></div><div class="content-area max-width align-center"><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598" src="http://www.vermintide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/decoration_1.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.vermintide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/decoration_1.png 480w, http://www.vermintide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/decoration_1-300x13.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" width="480" height="20"></p></div><div class="content-area max-width "><div class="cooked"><h3>Patch 1.1.0.3</h3><p>When we released mods in version 1.1.0, we opened up the game to be expanded into a million different, creative ways. Since mods can change just about everything about the game, we separate modders into a separate “realm”, where mods won’t allow you to do things like click a button to unlock all of Okri’s Challenges. That would be a bit unfair.</p><p>However, in order to make sure that mods weren’t able to change player data on our backend, we had to rewrite some of our network code to add extra layers of security.</p><p>The infamous backend error 1342 that kept popping up after 1.1.0, was a direct result of that rewrite.</p><p>This patch – 1.1.0.3, is a small patch which aims to resolve these backend errors.</p><p>Since the release of 1.1.0, we’ve also seen outages from both our backend hosting company, and Steam itself. We’re truly sorry about these issues impacting your games – we just want you to have fun killing rats.</p><p>There are still a few known issues with Challenges since 1.1.0 which we’re going to patch this week.</p><h3>Fixes &amp; Tweaks</h3><ul><li>Optimised opening of chests and crafting requests to the backend to avoid 1342 errors and cases where trusted players were meeting with a “denied” response upon manipulating their inventories. Eg: Finishing a map creates a chest in your inventory, which counts as inventory manipulation. This should address that scenario also.</li></ul></div><section class="post-menu-area clearfix"><nav class="post-controls clearfix"><div class="actions"></div></nav></section></div><div class="content-area max-width align-center"><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598" src="http://www.vermintide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/decoration_1.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.vermintide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/decoration_1.png 480w, http://www.vermintide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/decoration_1-300x13.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" width="480" height="20"></p></div><div class="content-area max-width "><div class="cooked"><h3>Patch 1.1.0.2</h3><p>Patch 1.1.0.2 isn’t a big one (~20mb) and solves a couple of crashes as well as tidies up the Keep once more.</p><ul><li>Reverted the Skull Keep to the old Keep.</li><li>Fixed a crash that could occur when leaving the game at the same time as starting or stopping a revive.</li><li>Fixed a crash that could occur when blocking Ratling Gunner fire.</li></ul></div></div><div class="content-area max-width align-center"><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598" src="http://www.vermintide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/decoration_1.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.vermintide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/decoration_1.png 480w, http://www.vermintide.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/decoration_1-300x13.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" width="480" height="20"></p></div><div class="content-area max-width "><h3>Patch 1.1.0.1</h3><p>We’re aware of a few issues tied to this update, including the infamous 1342 error which can occur when manipulating inventories (opening chests, salvaging items, rerolling etc) and are working full steam to resolve this.
