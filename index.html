Which includes plenty of bug fixes and tweaks, three new missions and five new weapons for players who own Back to Ubersreik. Our DLC policy for Vermintide 1 is something that we are very proud of. Players who owned a DLC, could invite their friends along for the ride &#8211; not everyone in the party had to be owners. We felt that was a fair deal. But for Vermintide 2, when we released our first DLC &#8220;Shadows over Bögenhafen&#8221;, we received feedback from our players that, because of how Quickplay works, the value proposition of our DLCs wasn&#8217;t all that clear. So for this release, we&#8217;re changing how access to DLC missions works. From now on, in order to host a Custom game with a DLC mission, or have that mission be selected for Quickplay &#8211; you, or another player in your Keep, will have to own that DLC. Where it was previously possible to join a DLC mission through Quickplay, even if you didn&#8217;t own that DLC, from today that won&#8217;t be the case. You will have to join a friend who owns it.</p><p>These changes also affect the missions from the Shadows over Bögenhafen DLC. We&#8217;re in the process of making more finely grained options for random mission selection in Quickplay. In the next major update, planned for January, we will present players the option of playing only certain sets of missions &#8211; excluding, or including DLC levels.</p><div class="bb_h1"><b>Patch 1.4.0.1 Hotfix</b></div><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Fixed a crash caused by using Bardin&#8217;s Drakefire Pistols.</li><li>Fixed a crash that could occur at the end of Engines of War.</li></ul><h4><b>Patch 1.4</b></h4><h4>Levels</h4><ul><li><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Added three new levels, remastered classics from Vermintide 1 - Horn of Magnus, Gardens of Morr, and Engines of War.

Previously, the game displayed latency as the time for network packets to travel between clients and host - it didn't take into account the performance of the host, or the client. The new latency display will include processing time for both the host and client. This means that an underperforming host will show a larger latency than the \&quot;ping\&quot; you might be used to from other games.\nAs this is can be a contentious issue, we've added an option to display latency from the Network Options menu - which includes an explanation of how this metric is calculated.
