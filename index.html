We've also made effort to shuffle the meta and bring THP away from ranged gameplay and reward melee combat instead. <br><br>We’re not done in terms of balance, but we’re happier with where the game is right in 1.3, and as always we welcome your feedback here, or in any of our social channels.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/30503110/0d7662ce98f71348b6aa84a057e6ee807c816c2e.png"><br><br><div class="bb_h1">General Combat Balance</div><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Gaining temporary health pauses temp health decay for 3 seconds.<br></li><li>Removed stamina regain burst when gaining temp health.<br></li><li>Dodge improvements have been made to make them more reliable across the board.</li></ul><br><div class="bb_h1">Weapon Balance</div><br><b>Flails for Saltzpyre</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Increased light attack damage by 33% for attack three and four.<br></li><li>Increased light attack stagger power by 72% for attack three and four.<br></li><li>Increased heavy attack damage against first target hit by 45%.<br></li><li>Increased heavy attack stagger power against first target by 45%.</li></ul><br><b>1h Swords for Kruber &amp; Sienna</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Increased heavy attack damage versus Infantry, Monster and Frenzy by 51%.<br></li><li>Increased heavy attack damage versus armored increased by 283%..<br></li><li>Increased first two light attacks damage by 28%.<br></li><li>Increased stagger strength and duration for third light attack by 42%.<br></li><li>Changed push followup to heavier version - effectively increasing cleave, damage and stagger across the board. <br></li><li>Tuned movement curve for light combo finisher to provide a burst of speed. <br></li><li>Increased Stamina from 3 to 4 shields.<br></li><li>Increased range of light attacks slightly.<br></li><li>Increased light combo attack speed.</li></ul><br><b>Maces for Sienna</b><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Increased damage and stagger for first two targets of heavy combo sweeping attacks by 47%.<br></li><li>Increased stagger strength and duration for downward light attack by 72%.

					Stop doing your "PGM balance greedy nerfing patches". It only balances YOUR vision of the game, not the gamers one.<br>The game is getting even boring patch after patch. Noobs are getting much more numerous everyday in public games. When lvl 30, we can get into a game with one lvl 5 and 2 lvl 10, what's the point with that? Do you call this "balancing"?<br>So stop your fake balancing job and fixe the real bugs that are reported since day one (that's weird because updates a 7,7 gb and nothing new in game... funny).<br>Make a game for gamers, not for developpers and PGM.<br>We didn't pay a 30 euros game to see it becoming worse with time (and, again, with all theses bugs reported and not patched since day one) 			</div>

					Finally, I will say that 2 Vermintaid continues to only disappoint me. Longer DLCs with huge crowds and a bunch of special enemies at a time, deteriorating the balance to increase the difficulty for players who only play this game days and nights. All these are only mistakes, not work on them. The first part was better and more pleasant.			</div>

					5 - And now let's talk about the revived daily tasks and events. Developers seriously think that people will have an incentive to tear♥♥♥♥♥for the sake of chests and frames? Where is the incentive to do that, eh?<br>In my vault of the emperor it is easier to knock out after passing the level on the legend.<br>Why, for all the shortcomings, 2 parts of developers are concerned with some kind of more accurate balance than now? Why do they cut according to the balance of the main characters and worry about the greater complexity of the game than now? They are not only that the assassins of 2-3 pieces for the races appear with a minimum interval in time? or Pak-master and and assassin with a flamethrower and a boss?			</div>

					4 - Smelly chests with standard drop rates. Now the red weapon falls less often and often falls trinkets, which are already in bulk or a second weapon, and the creation of the necessary not only that requires you to melt 5 unnecessary red garments does not give a unique illusion either.<br>Loss of costumes in general is not a story for the faint of heart. In the first part, the caps fell on the legend with a greater chance than now from the incentive chests. What made them do so that the caps would fall only from the promotional chests, I do not know, but believe me - it’s extremely unpleasant to open 15 incentive chests in a row and not get anything, by the way, since then I haven’t followed anything for kindling forging.			</div>

					I thought that part 2 is the work on the bugs, and not the creation of even bigger mistakes.<br>Let's take it in order.<br>1 - spoiled the menu of items and forge it became somehow more standard, and in fact in 1 part it was a nice looking and comfortable.<br>2 - spoiled both the appearance of trinkets and their uniqueness. Previously, they were and looked nice and hung right on the heroes, now they like perks you create and nothing else.<br>3 - Making weapons and trinkets was simply castrated. In Part 1, this was done more pleasantly and you could quickly do what you want, for example, 5 identical guns gave one more powerful. Now everyone has been transferred to an unnecessary currency, which even chew♥♥♥♥♥ but no use, because now the options for assemblies are minimal, everyone takes only 1-2 more effective options.<br>			</div>
