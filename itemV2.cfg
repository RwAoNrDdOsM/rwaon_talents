title = "[Beta] Vermintide 2 Reworks";
description = "
I'm going to release this in it's current state, so it may be broken and may be buggy. This is a project I've been working on for the better part of 6-7 months. Zaphio was the one who started the coding, but as I learnt how to code, I took over as the only coder.
The group of contributors I have is the group of people who have helped me with this, basically being the brain of this project helping me try to make Vermintide 2 better.
The reason I'm releasing this version to the public is that the Winds of Magic Expansion solves some of the problems that I made changes to, so I want to start a new with V2R, what it will be, I'm not entirely sure yet.
Anyhow, I hope you check  it out. There is some really good stuff in here (Fireball changes, Ironbreakers's ult, Hukon's Wrath) and some pretty bad stuff (Handmadien's Tier 1) but it would be alot of fun to play around with. I may fix bugs some bugs that are big but can't guarantee I will.

-Glaive
Made light attacks cancelable with blocks and weapon switches
Some increase to light damage
Removal of linesman
Reduction of damage-cleave

[code]Glaive reworked. This was done in order to change it be a more single-target oriented weapon rather than a horde clearing weapon. The weapon should now cleave to, and damage a second target, but stop there. In exchange, it will do increased damage to the first target, and offer a powerful choice as an elite killing weapon.[/code]

-Volley Crossbow
Volley Crossbow is now available on all Careers (and crash prevention stuff from Any Weapon)
Fixed Aimed in shot

-Hagbane
Increased weapon switching after lights from 0 to 0.2 (consistent with all other bows)
Decreased weapon switching after heavy from 0.66 to 0.5 (slightly faster than other actions, which seems to be generally consistent)
Decreased Dodge count from 6 to 5

-Shortbow/Swift Bow
Decreased Speed of light arrows from 8000 to 5500, this put it above Hagbane lights but under Longbow lights
Remove the weapon reload tech as it is stupid


-Longbow
Increased movement decrease when shooting lights from 0.5 to 0.65 (0.5 made it feel a bit sluggish)
Made lights be able to hit a max of two targets instead of one
Decreased weapon switching after heavy from 0.5 to 0.4
Decreased going back into drawing the bow after heavy from 0.55 to 0.45
Decreased weapon switching from aiming from 0.3 to 0 (it just feels horrible at 0.3)
Increased zoom delay in aiming from 0.01 to 0.2 (to account for weird zooming if you zooming and switching weapons)
Increased movement decrease when aiming from 0.25 to 0.5 (0.25 is just way too slow to be viable, 0.5 puts it at a good place when it is still slower than hagbane but not too slow)
